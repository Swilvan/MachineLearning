# MachineLearning
MachineLearning stuff for learning and fun! Following the coursera course on MachineLearning I'll be implementing some (or all) of the algorithms discussed there. Also I'll be messing around with sbt, akka, akka-http and such for even more learning and fun. 

### SimpleLinearRegression
Yay we learn the optimally fitting function (over just one variable) through gradient descent
